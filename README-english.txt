<< Simple Guide for recording your voices >>

  In simple case, You use only 3 keys to record your voices. 

    (1) 'r'              ... record your voice while 'r' is pushing
    (2) 'space key'      ... play recorded sound
    (2) 'down arrow key' ... save your recorded voice, and move next

  When you push 'down arrow key', your voice has saved in 'result'
  folder of OREMO.

  If you want to see spectrogram, F0 (pitch) curve and so on, 
  right click in waveform panel.

  In addition, OREMO have 'auto recording mode'. In this mode, 
  you can record voices according to the guidance BGM. 
  And you don't need to operate any keys at all while recording. 
  However, currently, it's hard to me to describe how to do it in English..
  
  I guess following English tutorials in YouTube would be 
  helpful to you...

  Currently, I'm developing OREMO for mainly Japanese singers 
  who want to make UTAU-voicebanks. 
  But I'm happy if some foreign singers use OREMO.
