# OREMO_Unicode

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

I am working on another way to do this, which will be as minimal as possible and will _ONLY_ support UTF-8 encoding.

I have successfully confirmed working on Mac OS X (may need XQuartz) and Linux. It is still mainly based on Snack but I am trying to use PortAudio only due to Snack being ancient and barely works. I am also working on the continuous integration of this.

Meanwhile, please kindly bear with me.
